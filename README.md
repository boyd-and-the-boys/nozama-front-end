Welcome to **Gen√®ric Assemblage**, an artisanal fashion-forward boutique specializing

swinging night out on the town, these beautifully crafted garments are sure to
dazzle and delight all the lucky souls who lay eyes upon you!

Multiple technologies were used in building this webpage, including **Node**, **Express**,
**Mongo**, **JavaScript**, **Heroku**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **Handlebars** and **Stripe**.

Our overarching approach to building this website was highly methodical and
step-driven; we focused heavily on planning out each day by using scrum meetings
and whiteboarding to our great benefit. We chose the gitflow approach to workflow,
meaning we created multiple development branches and only pushed finalized
code to the master branch.

Like any group of talented developers, we encountered a few hurdles while
constructing this wondrous homage to high-fashion. Most notably, we had a dandy
of a time integrating the Stripe API as our payment system. There were also a
couple hiccups using MLab to deploy our backend through Heroku.
