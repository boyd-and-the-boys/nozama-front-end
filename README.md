Multiple technologies were used in building this splendid webpage, including:

Node

Express

Mongo

Mongoose

JavaScript

Heroku

HTML

CSS

Bootstrap

Handlebars

Stripe

Our overarching approach to building this website was highly methodical and
step-driven; we focused heavily on planning out each day by using scrum meetings
and whiteboarding to our great benefit. We chose the gitflow approach to workflow,
meaning we created multiple development branches and only pushed finalized
code to the master branch.

Deployed back-end

Like any group of talented developers, we encountered a few hurdles while
constructing this wondrous homage to high-fashion. Most notably, we had a dandy
of a time integrating the Stripe API as our payment system. There were also a
couple hiccups using MLab to deploy our backend through Heroku.
